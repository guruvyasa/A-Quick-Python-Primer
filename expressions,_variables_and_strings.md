# Expressions, Variables and Strings
Before we start, you need to start a new python interpreter session. Python interpreter is a software which can intrepret and run python programs. It runs through your python program line-by-line executing each one at a time. Thus you can either open up an interactive interpreter session and try out python instructions one at a time or feed your entire python program as input to the interpreter. We will be working in the interactive interpreter in this chapter. 

### Starting interactive interpreter
#### Linux:
> $python3 [enter]
 
#### Windows:
* install python3 
* open IDLE ide and launch interpreter or in the command line enter python followed by enter key

Once the interpreter is running you will see a prompt like
> \>>>


**Note: It is better to use ipython console than the default python console as it provides many features including indentation out-of-the-box **

You can now start typing in any python command here:
Eg:
> \>>>1 + 2

> \>>>3

> \>>>2 * 3

> \>>>6

> \>>>2 - 3

> \>>> -1

Here we tested +,- and * operators for addition,subtraction and multiplication respectively. The interpreter echoes the output of the expression evaluated. Let us see the division operator now.

> 
> \>>>2 / 3

> \>>>0.6666666666666666

> \>>>2 // 3

>\>>>0

There are two division operators in python 3, **/** for real division (gives actual quotient) and **//** gives the truncated result.

Python also has a power operator **\*\***
>\>>>2 \*\* 3

>\>>>8

**%** is the modulus operator
> \>>>3 % 2

>\>>>1
