# The for loop
As mentioned the for loop in python is different. It is actually a foreach loop. Let us look at an example:
How do you print your name 10 times?
```
for i in range(10):
  print('chandan')
  
```
* the range( ) function is a utility function which can be used to generate a set of numbers within a range. Its syntax is range(start,stop,step)
