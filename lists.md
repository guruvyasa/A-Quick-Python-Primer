# Lists
In this chapter we discuss a very important data structure which is a python built-in data type "List". A list is a linear collection of data. It can store ANYTHING. Lists in python have dynamic size ie. their size is same as the number of contents in the list. Since a list is an object, it has many methods which can be used to manipulate it. Lists are mutable ie. their contents can be changed. 

In this chapter, we discuss about all these features of a list and show the most common operations on a list.
