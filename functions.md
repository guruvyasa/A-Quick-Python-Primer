# Functions
Everything is an object in python. So are functions. Functions help us(programmers) organize our code properly. We should remember that each function must have **single** responsibility.
Defining functions in python is easy as shown:
```
def addTwo(a,b): #definition
  return a+b
  
sum = addTwo(3,4) #function call
print(sum)
```
